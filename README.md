  Path Finding <br/>

<hr>

## General Information
**Path Finding** is a program that can determine the shortest path from road segments on a map formed into a graph. In this program, the path finding algorithms implemented are UCS (Uniform Cost Search) and A-Star Search. The program starts by getting input from the user in the form of a choice of one algorithm and a file containing the number of nodes, the name of each node, and an adjacency matrix whose distance is represented in meters. After that, the user can choose a starting node and an ending node to then find the shortest path between them. The program will display the shortest path along with its distance. This program was created to fulfill small task 3 of the IF2211 Algorithm Strategy course.
